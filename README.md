# Misc
This is a collection of various notebooks and other assets I've perused for various gigs/experiments/requests.

To be on the safer side, I must warn you that the code here is not meant for production WHATSOEVER, and is provided as is without any gaurantees or warranties.
Moreover, do note that its been cobbled together by me merely for fun. All the errors are mine and mine alone, while each piece of interesting code is most definitely
written by somebody who isn't me.

I've tried my best to mention all my sources where I've used the notebooks.
